# UnityExtended 
Libraries to extend Unity Project.  
The idea is share some methods for some stater devs and get some help of other developers. (You can make a PR and help me)

## Libraries

- **Colver**  
Entension classes to Unity's build classes.

- ***Entities (Obsolete)***  
Default Entities classes and interfaces to Unity Games. Probably will become a especific library.  

## How to Build
You can download the project and in the root folder of each project you can open the command prompt and restores it's dependencies with **```dotnet restore```**. After that type : **```dotnet build```** and go to **/bin/Debug** folder and the .dll will be there
So you can just put that in your project.  
  
The Solution uses theses Dependencies :
- UnityEngine
- UnityEngine.Core

.NET Framework 4.5
